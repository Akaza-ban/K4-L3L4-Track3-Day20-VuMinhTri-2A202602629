description: Read all existing source files, docstrings, and tests thoroughly before making any changes to understand expected behavior and edge cases.

Before editing any file:
1. Read the full source file(s) you'll modify — don't rely on partial views.
2. Pay special attention to docstrings: they often specify rounding rules, formatting requirements, and edge-case behavior (e.g., "round half up", "parentheses mean negative", "quote fields containing commas").
3. If tests exist, read them to understand expected outputs exactly.
4. Run the existing code with sample inputs to see current behavior before changing it.
5. Never assume behavior from function names alone — the docstring is the contract.
